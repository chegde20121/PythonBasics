# My First Python Learning Project

Welcome to my first Python project! This project was created to learn and practice Python programming concepts. In this project, you'll find various Python scripts that demonstrate different programming topics, exercises, and examples.

## Features

- **Basic Python Concepts**: Get familiar with basic Python syntax, data types, and control structures.
- **Intermediate Python Topics**: Dive into more advanced topics like object-oriented programming, file handling, and error handling.
- **Hands-on Exercises**: Practice what you've learned with interactive exercises and examples.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12.0
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-first-python-project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd my-first-python-project
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd my-first-python-project
    ```

2. Run a Python script:

    ```bash
    python script_name.py
    ```

Replace `script_name.py` with the name of the Python script you want to run.
